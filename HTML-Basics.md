**What is HTML?**
1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

4. The <<code>html</code>> element is the **root element** of an HTML page.
5. The <</code>head</code>> element contains **meta information** about the HTML page
6. The <<code>title</code>> element specifies a **title for the HTML page** (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
7. The <<code>body</code>> element defines the document's body, and is a **container for all the visible contents**, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

**What is an HTML Element?**
1. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
Example: <<code>p</code>>This is a paragraph      with no extra spaces<<code>/p</code>>
2. Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!
3. HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
4. HTML is Not Case Sensitive, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
