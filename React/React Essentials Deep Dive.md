**Single Parent Element Requirement in JSX:**
1. JSX allows writing HTML-like structures but is converted to JavaScript function calls (e.g., React.createElement).
2. Returning multiple elements from a JSX expression directly isn't allowed in JavaScript.
3. Similar to how functions can only return one value, JSX expressions need a single root element.
4. Wrapping sibling elements in a parent element (e.g., div) provides a single return value.
5. While not strictly necessary for functionality, extra DOM elements might be created due to the parent wrapper.
6. To avoid extra DOM nodes, you can use the **React.Fragment** component, which acts as a placeholder without rendering anything.
7. Modern React projects often support an even shorter syntax: empty tags **(<<code></code>> and <<code>/</code>>).**

**Breaking Down Large Components in React:**
1. **Signs of a Large Component:**
- Manages multiple unrelated functionalities (e.g., rendering, data fetching, state management).
- Updates in one section cause unnecessary re-renders in other parts.
- Complex logic and codebase within the component.
2. **Benefits of Splitting:**
- Improved maintainability and readability.
- Enhanced code reusability.
- Potential performance optimizations by isolating re-renders.
3. **Example:** Splitting App component into smaller components based on responsibilities (e.g., Header, CoreConcepts, InteractiveArea).
