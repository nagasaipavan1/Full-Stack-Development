**What is React:**
1. MVC -> Model View Controller
2. React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
3. React is a tool for building UI components.
4. You can write React code directly in HTML, But to use React in production, you need npm which is included with Node.js.

**How does React Work?**
1. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating,
    before making the changes in the browser DOM.
2. React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

**React.JS History:**

2. Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.

4. Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.
5. Current version of create-react-app is v5.0.1 (April 2022).
6. **create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.**

**What is ES6?**
1. ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
2. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.


**Why React?**
1. Fast Responsive.
2. Declarative UI Programming.  (Declarative means -> You define the goal, not the steps);

**Getting Started with React:**
1. Install Node.js on your Operating System.
2. We can now create react apps using **vite@latest** or **create-react-app**.
3. **npm install** is the command used to install all packages used in the react application.
4. For Vite, **npm run dev** is used to run the application.
5. **npm start** is the command for create-react-app.

**Why Do You Need A Special Project Setup?**
1. Why we can't create a html, and js file and run our code directly, is because we are using **HTML in JS** which is also called **JSX**.
2. The JSX code must be transformed into browser understandable code then only, the browser can execute the JSX code.
