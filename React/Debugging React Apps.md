**Debugging Logical Errors in React Applications:**
1. **Introduction:**
- Logical errors don't always trigger error messages in the console.
- Debugging these errors requires analyzing code execution and identifying discrepancies.
2. **Browser Developer Tools:**
- Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to examine code execution.
- Set breakpoints in the app.jsx file to pause execution at specific lines.
- Observe the paused code and variable values using the debugger.
- Use debugger controls (step, jump in/out) to navigate through code execution.
