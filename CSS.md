# Day-7:
**What is CSS?**
1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
3. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
4. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

5. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. (h1 is selector in the above img). 

**Three Ways to Insert CSS:** <br/>
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1. External CSS (in head tag use <<code>link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"</code>>)
2. Internal CSS (in head tag use <<code>style</code>>)
3. Inline CSS (use style attribute).

**Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px):
Incorrect (space): font-size: 20 px;
Correct (no space): font-size: 20px;**  <br/>

A CSS comment is placed inside the <<code>style</code>> element, and starts with /* and ends with */ <br/>

**CSS Backgrounds:**
1. The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.
2. background-color, image, repeat, attachment are already in HTML.md
3. background-position:	Sets the starting position of a background image. (ex: background-position: right top;)
4. The background-clip property defines how far the background (color or image) should extend within an element.
5. The background-origin property specifies the origin position (the background positioning area) of a background image.

**CSS Borders:**
1. The border-property(like width, color, style) property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border)
