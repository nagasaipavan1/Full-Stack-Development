# Day-7:
**What is CSS?**
1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
3. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
4. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

5. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. (h1 is selector in the above img). 

**Three Ways to Insert CSS:** <br/>
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1. External CSS (in head tag use <<code>link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"</code>>)
2. Internal CSS (in head tag use <<code>style</code>>)
3. Inline CSS (use style attribute).

**Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px):
Incorrect (space): font-size: 20 px;
Correct (no space): font-size: 20px;**
